##### the 1989, hard-hitting cyborg, renegade cop thriller that got cancelled after a stunning five-episode run. [www.nerdcop.com](www.nerdcop.com)

#####_wait, what is this?_

This is a **colllaborative**, **multimedia** storytelling project.  

The following skeleton details are static:

- The number of episodes
- The dominating themes of the episodes
- Several jungian archetypes/characters
- The genre (cop drama/1980s sci-fi)

but the everything else may be changed via pull-requests and talking with the project owners.

It may remain a script with multiple enactions, or be a video game, or be an animation, or be converted to init processes to be experienced at server boot -- it is whatever evolves from community interaction.
